LeoLuz Vim configuration files
======================================

About
-----

This is a project to maintain my Vim configuration files.
It uses [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) approach to manage Vim plugins.

Fill free to hack around and use these files as you wish but IMHO the best
way to learn is doing it by yourself.

Good luck!

Instalation
-----------

In your favorite shell type:

    cd ~
    git clone https://leoluz@github.com/leoluz/vimfiles.git .vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Start Vim and type:

    :PluginInstall

That's it! You are ready to go! 
Enjoy!
