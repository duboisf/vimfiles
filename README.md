LeoLuz Vim configuration files
======================================

About
-----

This is a project to maintain my NeoVim configuration files.
It uses [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) approach to manage Vim plugins.

Fill free to hack around and use these files as you wish but IMHO the best
way to learn is doing it by yourself.

Good luck!

Instalation
-----------

For the first time you start Vim it will automatically install all the needed plugins.

### Powerline symbols support

Its necessary to install the preferred powerline and symbols fonts:

    $ brew cask install font-powerline-symbols font-menlo-for-powerline

After installing just select the powerline version of your font in the terminal or nvim gui of choice.

### Golang support

To enable go auto-completion please refer to the [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/blob/master/doc/vim-go.txt) documentation.

### Typescript support

To enable Typescript support please refer to the [nvim-typescript](https://github.com/mhartington/nvim-typescript#installation) documentation.

That's it! You are ready to go! 
Enjoy!
